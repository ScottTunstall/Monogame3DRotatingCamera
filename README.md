# Monogame3DRotatingCamera

A camera revolving around a textured cube.

Handy when trying to understand the use of various matrixes and how they affect the output.

Use the cursor keys and + and - to move around and zoom in and out, respectively.

I am not the original author - I just updated the code to work with .NET 6.0.

I don't know who originally wrote this but I thank them anyway.
