# Monogame3DRotatingCamera

A camera revolving around a textured cube. Created with VS 2022, Monogame and .NET 6.

Handy when trying to understand the use of various matrixes and how they affect the output.

Use the cursor keys and + and - to move around and zoom in and out, respectively.

I am not the original author - I just updated the code to work with .NET 6.0.

I don't know who originally wrote this but I thank them anyway.
